# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning Repository

Welcome to this repository dedicated to learning and exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repo serves as a collection of resources, projects, and experiments designed to help you understand and apply NLP concepts, algorithms, and techniques. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, this repo provides the foundation and tools to guide you through the process of learning NLP.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on the interaction between computers and human language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. 

This repository contains various resources to help you learn NLP, including:
- Key algorithms and techniques
- Implementations of common NLP tasks
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing and feature extraction methods
- Evaluation metrics

## Key Concepts

The following are key concepts you will explore in this repository:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and format text data, such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Word Embeddings**: Methods like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText for representing words in continuous vector spaces.
- **Language Models**: Understanding and implementing models like n-grams, RNNs, LSTMs, and transformers.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., person, location, date) in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of a given text, whether itâ€™s positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Text Classification**: Assigning predefined labels to text (e.g., spam detection, topic categorization).
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Building models for machine translation, text summarization, and more.

## Projects and Examples

This repository includes a variety of hands-on projects and code examples. Some of the key projects include:

1. **Text Classification**: Implementing a model to classify text into categories like spam or non-spam.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing movie reviews or social media posts to determine their sentiment.
3. **Named Entity Recognition**: Extracting entities from text using both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.
4. **Language Modeling**: Building an RNN-based or Transformer-based language model from scratch.
5. **Machine Translation**: Implementing a simple translation model using sequence-to-sequence techniques.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-learning.git
   cd nlp-learning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Dependencies** may include libraries such as:
- `nltk` for basic NLP tasks
- `spacy` for advanced NLP operations
- `transformers` for transformer-based models
- `torch` and `tensorflow` for deep learning models
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models

## Usage

Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can start exploring the projects and examples. For example, to run a sentiment analysis example:

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd projects/sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to begin:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
   ```

Alternatively, you can run scripts directly from the command line:
```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

Refer to the individual project README files for more specific instructions on each project.
